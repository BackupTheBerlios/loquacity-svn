The examples directory contains a working server and consumer that use
the openid libraries.

To go through the example login:

1) install ( copy ) PHP-OpenID directory to a location
   somewhere under your docroot.


2) Open your web browser, and go to the consumer server:

	http://<yourserver>/<path-to-php-openid>/httpconsumer.php

   Note that all pages the consumer shows will have a yellow
   background.


4) Enter an identity url managed by the sample identity server:

        http://<yourserver>/<path-to-php-openid>/sampleserver.php/bob


5) The browser will redirect you to the sample server, which will want
   you to log in.  Enter the username for the identity url into login
   box:
 
        bob

   Note that all pages the id server shows will have a blue/purple
   background


6) After you log in as bob, the sample server will ask you if you want
   to allow http://<yourserver>/<path-to-php-openid>/httpconsumer.php
   to know your identity.  Say yes.


7) You should end up back on the consumer site (yellow background) at
   a page indicating how long it thinks you should stay logged in at
   the consumer's site.


You can then click on the "home" link and try different logins, to get
ideas of the flow through the sample system in different cases.  The id
server stores your current identity in your browser with a cookie, and
it stores what trust roots each user has authorized in a small table
in memory.  The main id server page has links to let you see and change 
who you are logged in as.  To reset the list of authorized trust_roots, 
restart the sample server.

------ 
In addition to the above examples, simple.php is a consumer-only 
example that simply verifies an identity.  Load simple.php in your browser 
to test a simple consumer in dumb mode.  The source code is well 
documented and a great intro to using the PHP-OpenID library.
